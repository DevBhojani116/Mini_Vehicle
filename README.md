# RC Car Project - WiFi Control and Obstacle Detection

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for our RC (Remote Control) car project.

## Project Features

- **WiFi Control**: The car can be controlled remotely via a WiFi connection, allowing for easy and convenient operation from a smartphone or computer.

- **Customizable Configuration**: The code allows for easy configuration of WiFi credentials, motor pins, and sensor connections to adapt the project to different hardware setups.

## Hardware Requirements

To replicate this project, you will need the following components:

- ESP8266-based WiFi module (e.g., ESP8266-01)
- L293D motor driver
- DC motors and wheels
- Power supply for the motors and the WiFi module
- RC car chassis and wheels

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Hardware Assembly**: Connect the components based on the provided wiring diagram (will be updated later... not yet added in the repo).

2. **Software Configuration**:
   - Flash the ESP8266 with the provided code.
   - Configure WiFi credentials and motor pins according to the code

3. **Upload Code**: Upload the modified code to the ESP8266 module.

4. **Power On**: Power up the RC car.

5. **Connect to WiFi**: Connect your smartphone or computer to the WiFi network created by the ESP8266 module. 

6. **Control Interface**: Access the control interface by using any ESP8266 app. We used [this app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bluino.esp8266wifirobotcar&hl=en-IN)


## Future Enhancements

Our future plans for this project include:

- Implementing autonomous navigation using obstacle detection.
